_Files and instructions for fixing Quixel Bridge connection with newer version of 3ds Max._

---

Quixel Bridge's official plugin has compatibility issues with newer versions of 3ds Max, particularly 2024 and 2025. This repository provides updated files and an optional assistant app to address these issues.
This project is licensed under the MIT License, granting full freedom to use, modify, and distribute this work.

I hope Quixel will officially fix these problems soon and they are welcome to use my simple code in any way if they want to.

## [Issues](#issues)

1. Version Limitation:

   - The plugin version file limits compatibility to 3ds Max 2023, preventing connections for newer versions like 2024 or 2025.

2. API Changes in 3ds Max 2025:

   - Starting from 2023, MaxPlus is no longer shipped with 3ds Max.
   - In 2025, Python APIs underwent significant changes, including updates to PySide2 and added support for PySide6. Quixel's plugin hasn't been updated to reflect these changes.

3. Code Duplication:
   - The original plugin code contains unnecessary duplication, which hasn't been addressed.

## [Changes](#changes)

### Whatâ€™s New:

- Reduced code duplication with minor refactoring.

- Unified compatibility for 3ds Max 2025 and higher, while maintaining support for older versions.

- Added functionality to handle menu creation for 3ds Max 2025+, accounting for API changes while ensuring seamless functionality across versions.

## [How to Use](#how-to)

You have two options to fix the issues:

1. Use the MaxBridge Assistant App (easy and automated).
2. Follow the manual process (slightly more involved).

### [1. MaxBridge Assistant (Easy Method)](#easy)

1. Close `"Quixel Bridge" & "3ds Max"`
   <br>

2. Download the app from release section of this repository.<br>[DOWNLOAD LINK]()
   <br>

3. Run the app (portable, no installation needed).
   <br>

4. Click `"Megascans Library Folder"` button and select your library folder
   <br>

5. Wait for the app to download and replace the necessary files.

## [2. Manual Method](#manual)

1. Close `"Quixel Bridge" & "3ds Max"`
   <br>

2. Locate the `"Megascans Library Folder"` on your system. Then navigate to:

   ```php

   <br>

   - Replace it with the version from this repository:

   <br>

6. RReplace the following file on your system:

```php
<Megascans Library Folder>\support\plugins\max\5.5\MSLiveLink\MS_API.py
